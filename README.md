# RoguEvE

You play the rogue drone AI and must defend the Hive against the capsuleer menace !

Assemble your team of five drones to defeat the ennemy ship(s).

Be sure to match the best variation of damage types and resistances to maximize your efficiency.


# Disclaimer

No Eve Online data is stored in the game, as everything is fetched asynchronously using the public CREST API ( https://public-crest.eveonline.com/ ).
The old XML (authentified) API is not used at all.

We've made a GameJolt Page for this game! Download the build here >>> http://gamejolt.com/games/rogueve/130368 <<<



# Foreword

We are partners in space, development and life!
We are web full stack developpment and this is our first game.

We have started the API Challenge late, and we'll be facing 2 main issues:

- short dead line... 2 weeks
- unmastered tech... Unity

# Afterword

We obviously had to cut through so many features... But we've learned a lot.
The end result does not aim to be a stand-alone clone of Eve online.
You should rather consider it as a prototype of a mobile application where any one could "assist" any player in space who has drones launched using his/her personal tablet, phone or web browser.

This asymetric gameplay introduces a concept rarely seen before in MMO's: "collaborative gameplay". In other words, how to give control to a ship to more than one player.

Although using the proper formulas to simulate a battle was possible, we've heavily simplified the mechanics to meet the deadline (the Rifter doesn't even have a weapon :/).

We hope you'll enjoy this prototype !
